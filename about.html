    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer from Johannesburg, South Africa</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        I possess a diverse educational background and hold expertise across multiple fields.
        My professional journey began as a receptionist for a funeral investment services firm, where I gained invaluable experience in administrative duties and client relations over the course of one year.
        <br />
        <br />
        Driven by a passion for healthcare,
        I pursued further education at Wits University and subsequently worked in the medical field for five years, in school of nursing.
        Transitioning into the corporate world,
        I served as a secretary at a private electrical contractor company for three years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired to broaden my horizons, I pursued a National Diploma in Civil Engineering, expanding my knowledge base and skill set.
        Throughout my journey, I have remained committed to lifelong learning,
        continually seeking new opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge.
        <br />
        <br />
        I believe in the power of continuous growth.
        I am always eager to embrace challenges
        and explore new avenues for personal and professional development.
